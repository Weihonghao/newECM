You 're in trouble . 
You book bets , you lose , you pay off . 
That girl with the big ass , she was the reason . 
In my family the biggest sin was to buy retail . 
Shit , they 're all tough . 
You 'll take off and fly up your own ass . 
They 're trying to sell the cold war . 
Let Sussman do his own dirty work . 
Words fail me . 
That 's the trouble . 
It is a problem , no doubt about it . 
Nothing to worry about . 
Who wants trouble ? 
No reporters , no publicity . 
Then how am I going to know when I 'm mad ? 
Don 't worry about it , really . 
Worry about who 's gonna write scripts . 
And I 'm not going to do anything that makes you ashamed of me . 
I remind you that placing bets is a crime . 
A dull ... 
That means a bigger offensive . 
You 're quite wrong . 
You 're a fool . 
Don 't talk nonsense . 
One day you 'll stop a bullet and it 'll all be worthless . 
I don 't mind the war now . 
Many killed and many wounded . 
You 're dead . 
We have to kill . 
I 've been betrayed ! 
Paul , you 've been starving yourself . 
Coward ! 
And if you could , get a job that 's not quite so dangerous . 
Aah , I think it broke my shin . 
Maybe we can do something together later on when the war is over . 
Don 't talk nonsense . 
One day you 'll stop a bullet and it 'll all be worthless .

That means a bigger offensive . 
You 're quite wrong . 
You 're a fool . 
That you would die in a strange place . 
Who can say what suffering still awaits us . " 
Don 't rush me , I have a weak heart . 
But no , no ... 
Sadly , you don 't have it , Mr. Sérigny . 
And he has even less talent to be a murderer . 
You idiot ! 
Everybody here steals what he wants . 
Not even a thief is as foolish , because he keeps his booty . 
- ... madame , doesn 't eschew danger . 
See that you get out , you wimp ! 
Your life 's in danger ? 
A doll , a doll feels no pain . 
Mr. Dumontier , a disaster ! 
You don 't have to worry about me . 
Aren 't you ashamed ? 
Jailed ... 
And don 't worry about the critics . 
Tired . 
stop that damned singing ! stop it ! 
I 'm starved . 
- That 's awful . 
Don 't worry , Frau Schlotterbeck . 
- Nonsense ! 
Terrible . 
Your father hates all this publicity . 
He 's killed her ! 
The attacker left footprints , you see 
The killer stole them to throw suspicion on this poor fellow . 
You want to destroy me ! 
Since this outrageous attack I haven 't seen Mile Stangerson . 
I mean , no – no , it wasn 't me ! 
I 'm just tired this evening 
Arrested ? 
He has confessed that he attacked you 
He is incapable of killing the gamekeeper . 
For weeks you have been too ill for Mr. Larsan 's interrogation 
I will have him arrested at once ! 
The night before the crime , probably . 
Larsan is dead . 
I alone killed the gamekeeper 
Died . 
What could have caused the death of Louis . 
Sorry if annoying . 
Because women fear will ... impaired children to face life . 
- You scared me - Return late . 
" Pregnant women are your weakness ? 
I sucked everything ! 
No wonder you do poor business ! 
Bad blood ? 
What 's wrong with the guy ? 
After all , professor , you can 't blame the problem , can you ? 
Don 't be sad ! 
some crazy ideas about her job ! 
Who gives a damn ? 
Her temper hasn 't grown any sweeter with time . 
No wonder you do poor business ! 
Bad blood ? 
What 's wrong with the guy ? 
- Hey , did you ever kill a dead lndian ? 
Feed 'em well and feed 'em right and we 'll have no trouble . 
Because this is dangerous country , and anything might happen . 
Don 't worry . 
We 're building a nation , so we 've got to suffer . 
- You can 't do this awful thing ... take two lives ! 
You 'll be froze to death in an hour . 
- Hey , did you ever kill a dead lndian ? 
- I 'm really tired , Mr Thorpe . 
This is dangerous country , and anything might happen . 
Don 't worry . 
We 're building a nation , so we 've got to suffer . 
You 'll be froze to death in an hour . 
Are the animals becoming distrustful ? 
You suffer and have to work hard 
Damned lion ! 
Now I am widowed ... 
Damn ! missed it . 
Or the king will send his armies and you 'll die . 
- The devil - - No a fox - 
Now I am widowed ...

No wound stripes when we are hurt 
Return the prisoner to the guard- house 
Those women must be mad . 
Not badly written for a soldier 
- Is he badly wounded ? 
No official injury signs , if we 're wounded . 
There are 100 ways to die . 
Not bad handwriting for a soldier ! 
ls he badly injured ? 
You 're a scream . 
Oh , you 're tired , you sick , Anna . 
Anna , you was scaredI got hurt . 
You 're as stiff as a corpse . 
Not ifI have to kill you first . 
I hated him and he knew it .

And we 'll be happy , the two of us , in spite of the devil .

You 're a little bit mad . 
Unless I kill you first . 
- No , I think I 'm getting old and stupid . 
Telephone me the moment that you 'vve destroyed them . 
Alexis , don 't think wrong of me . 
It merely illustrates what a fool I made of myself .

" You 'll fight him ! " 
" You 'll fight him ! " 
But still , I worry . 
And you really believe that you can bring life to the dead ? 
Dead , hey ? 
Anyone can see with half an eye that there 's something wrong .

You look so tired .

In fact , a more poisonous little barbecue I 've never attended . 
- No fooling ? 
Mr. Oxly , that may be dangerous . 
- No , no , Gus . 
Oh , it even makes the water taste bitter . 
Oh , what a shame . 
I 'm liable to knock somebody 's block off . 
Why are you crying ? 
Now , it 's all my fault . 
So then you are angry . 
Aversion to you ? 
What a fool I was to let you take that stuff last night . 
Barnaby , when we get mad , we don 't fight , do we ? 
No , no , no . 
No , no , I don 't want it . 
Now , Mrs. Fulton , don 't cry . 
Oh , poor Barnaby .

Had me arrested ! 
Not bad . 
We fly or are killed . 
You trick men into death with your body .

Not a bad death , to die for my country . 
You have no fear of this death ?

Echoing to our Iaughter , As though the dead were there . " 
I 'II Ieave you to your count and his ruined abbey .

That wasn 't my fault . 
It doesn 't disgust me as with old Marchal . 
Fearing a violent scene , the lady called for help . 
Don’ t get mad … he did say nothing . 
You’ re a bitch . 
He has no heart … no upbringing . 
What about this white slavery business ?

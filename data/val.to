I 'm waiting for the only one who really behaves like a man 
He isn 't a romantic hero . 
Interesting ! 
I take the Vallier , and you madame 's virtue . 
Well , you surely know !

For heaven 's sake , where 's my passport ? 
Just trust Colwyn and his connections . 
No brilliance . 
Good God , Albert , what 's the matter ? 
Good evening , ladies .

Yeah , yeah . 
- You wouldn 't care . 
It 's Black Elk and some of his braves . 
No great trail was ever blazed without hardship . 
It 's frontier justice . 
It may help me . 
- No , I never killed a dead one . 
Do you mind if I say good night ? 
- You wouldn 't care . 
It 's Black Elk and some of his braves .

How handsome my Alexis was in his dress uniform . 
He was the hot- blooded kind . 
Fortunately , both her husband and I are peaceful men . 
No … but I got an idea he was laughing at us all the time . 
You lick the hand that feeds you … the hand that beats you too . 
Lucienne … you don’ t love me anymore ? 
Oh , not white slavery ! 
Foreman , will you please read the verdict ?

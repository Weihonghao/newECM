How handsome my Alexis was in his dress uniform . 
He was the hot- blooded kind . 
Fortunately , both her husband and I are peaceful men . 
No … but I got an idea he was laughing at us all the time . 
You lick the hand that feeds you … the hand that beats you too . 
Lucienne … you don’ t love me anymore ? 
Oh , not white slavery !

Such a good lad . 
She always loved a party . 
When one isn 't rich , one has to work . 
I 'll give her everything she wants - money , jewels ... 
And he won 't get the shop till his dad dies . 
I know one who 'd love to hit you .

Did he say he loved her ? 
Maybe he doesn 't love her . 
This should be easy to settle . 
Laugh if you like , but it 's the truth . 
Just 'cause he 's handsome , does he have to marry a Rothschild ? 
I know you love Fanny . 
You love Fanny . 
You can 't love the girl . 
It isn 't true . 
You were always in my dreams of the future .

You don 't look too good .

I love you too much , you know that . 
I suppose you guys had a good run for your money ... 
Careful what you wish for . 
We don 't care ! 
Make sure they 're clean . 
Get ready ! 
They 'll bury us alive to save time . 
Help ! 
- It 's to see who 's not dead yet . 
Time to clear out ! 
We 're safe here , with 12 feet of earth above us .

And I did so want to bring you luck . 
Well , the fun will just have to go on without me . 
Wait , darling , till I get my mules . 
Well , how do you like New York ? 
Didn 't I tell you she was clever ? 
There won 't be any publicity . 
Happens I 'm in love with my husband .

- Good gracious ! 
Come on , let 's laugh it off . 
Well , well , Mr. Zilch , how are you ? 
- Yes , sir . 
But , Doctor , please , please . 
- Otto , help him . 
Easy , now . 
- I wish you 'd go back to your room . 
- That 's a good idea , Otto . 
I wish I were away from it . 
He 's working under a terrific strain . 
- Thank you , Dr. Wells . 
I 'm convinced . 
Yes , look at it , a real hand . 
You 've won the lottery with him . 
Yes , I know , you 're throwing me out . 
I 'm here to do you a favour . 
I love you . 
Are you happy ? 
Everything is ready ! 
She 's such a good person 
Hipo , be strong ! 
It 's just the medal ceremony now . 
I find it thrilling . 
Madam the Princess of Chabran wins the first prize in one voice . 
An old friend Loulou invited without telling me . 
And I who went to see it every month , for pleasure . 
A good piece of advice ! 
So you don 't care that your wife is a flirt ! 
It 's perfectly justified , Madam . 
It 's a small price to pay for our happiness . 
" I don 't love you anymore " . 
That won 't do any good to your affairs . 
Yes . 
Well , dear , I decided to come home for dinner after all . 
Yes , sir ! 
Oh , doesn 't look so good at that . 
Well , he can 't move , dear . 
If you get to know 50 beautiful women ... be this way , will you ? 
I 'll wade through the mud and love it . 
I hope I will be lucky enough to find it . 
I want you to accept these as a token of our friendship . 
OK , chief . 
They just laughed at it . 
You better look out . 
That might prove effective . 
Just one more , darling , and then you 'll have to dress . 
I don 't mind people having a good time . 
But I 'm happy , darling .

All ready , Your Honor 
Yes , dear , he 's your father . 
Pleasure , Miss Malloy . 
- Yes . 
Carnarvon made his dream come true . 
Yes , I 've heard Father speak of him to the men . 
- I know he won 't do that . 
- Please sit down so that we can enjoy your visit . 
- Yes . 
Yes . 
- Yes . 
The splendor of the world is yours . 
Yes , that 's what I think . 
It 's wonderful to care for those one loves . 
I 'm not going to ruin my life . 
I want my freedom . 
I 'm not going to ruin my life . 
I want my freedom 
I 'm not going to ruin my life . 
I want my freedom 
He 's a hard case on hand ... 
One feels much safer here than in my bed . 
Thank God it 's only a piece of her . 
I am always OK . 
I won 't tolerate that ! 
I advise you to accept the sentence . 
Yes , you do . 
- He 'd be glad ! 
- It 's good ... 
Such a pride of the family ! 
I am not a murderer . 
Was your family rich ? 
- Very true . 
- Take care of her . 
Yes , he 's here . 
Who can I trust ... 
Help me . 
Try to relax . 
They 're good at that . 
Let me save you . 
I don 't care . 
Well , ladies , let 's combine business with pleasure . 
It simply won 't stand the wear and tear . 
The world 's bright for the first time in three years . 
That 's no way for a great big man to act . 
I 'll give his party special attention . 
To trade the liberty of his associate for his own . 
I expected to meet a lot of interesting people and talk to them . 
That 's funny . 
You 've won . 
I 'll take care of everything in the house . 
It 's true . 
But , Joan , you and Jerry are gonna be so happy . 
I can take care of her , all right . 
I won 't even let him out of my sight . 
You should have complete rest and relaxation . 
Buck didn 't give us time to say good evening . 
If she dies , you won 't have to . 
Yes . 
Yes , there 's a two cent tax on every check you write . 
Well , that 's nice of her . 
I 'd begun to think you weren 't coming to the party . 
What a wise mother . 
Enjoy your ride ? 
You 're very kind . 
Why did you lie to me if it wasn 't true ? 
Yes . 
Yes , there 's a two cent tax on every check you write . 
Well , that 's nice of her . 
I 'd begun to think you weren 't coming to the party .

Enjoy your ride ? 
But now you know better , don 't you ? 
You 're very kind . 
Why did you lie to me if it wasn 't true ? 
- Yes , I guess it does . 
- Powerful cider , ain 't it ? 
Everybody loves everybody . 
But you haven 't the comforts ... 
And I 'm as smart now as I ever will be . 
I 've been very happy there . 
Yes , I guess it does . 
Powerful cider , ain 't it , Tom ? 
Everybody loves everybody . 
But you haven 't the comforts ... 
And I 'm as smart now as I ever will be . 
I 've been very happy there . 
But it 's wonderful . 
- I thought she was splendid . 
Yes , I know . 
- Will Mr. Kringelein kindly sign here ? 
Besides , she 's rather pretty . 
I was little , slim , but hard as a diamond . 
- That 's very interesting . 
Save that for the office . 
- You don 't like to see me enjoying myself . 
- He was a nice fellow . 
You always felt better when he came along . 
You loved the Baron , didn 't you ? 
I won 't live long . 
We 'll find a great doctor . 
But it 's wonderful . 
- I thought she was splendid . 
Yes , I know . 
- Will Mr. Kringelein kindly sign here ? 
- I wish I were free tonight . 
Not even the Veronal can help me to sleep .

We were friends . 
I do appreciate the courtesy . 
Nothing nearly as grand , Lieutenant . 
Well , I 'll tell you , that 's a relief to hear . 
Yes , a logical question . 
I 'd be delighted . 
If I can ever be of any help ... 
I enjoyed it . 
I was clearly in line for the position that you gave George . 
The least I could hope for is some understanding from my wife . 
Born smart , as they say . 
Yes , yes , you 've demonstrated all that . 
Ah , yes , here we are . 
A glorious , torn Paraguayan flag flutters over the fort walls . 
- Yes , yes . 
How beautiful you are , more than ever this evening , Mariù ! 
Speak to me of love , Mariù ! 
Speak to me of love , Mariù ! 
Good night . 
" Do you love China ? " 
Please forgive him ! ... " 
This is a day of joy and happiness for all of us . 
And he didn 't even raise a hand to defend himself 
And God will help you , my boy . 
Yes , yes ... 
Hold yourself in , and save it up for a real Frenchman . 
I 'm not a sick man . 
To make a long story short , I wish to marry Elsa . 
Wonderful day . 
It was inspiration as it only had been given to you by God . 
Always trusting , believing anybody . 
Be a good girl , please stay in that room with your grandmother . 
I think you 'd better go back tonight . 
Open unto us the door of thy loving- kindness 
Hit the sympathy seeker ! 
The sympathy seeker ! 
Work ; but your strength let union teach . 
# To break - why then , to- morrow , truly , 
# Help me ??? . 
That book is outstanding ! 
In memory of my dad , help me . 
But I 'm waiting since three years , dear ! 
Do you mean that he has got time to be happy ? ... 
- So , do you like it here ? 
You won 't find anything cleaner in the world . 
I don 't care if he is your son . 
In her heart , she 'll be happy . 
To speak to me like that !
